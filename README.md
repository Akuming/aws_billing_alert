### AWS BILLING ALERTING
I wrote this code just as a reference point to setting up a billing alert to send your AWS bill to your email every day at a specific
time.

You can use this code as a lambda function that can be used to connect to an AWS SNS topic so that the email subscribed to that topic
will get the alert.
